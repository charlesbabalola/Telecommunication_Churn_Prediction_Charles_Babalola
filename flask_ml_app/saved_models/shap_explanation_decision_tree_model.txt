The feature importance analysis indicates that the most influential factors in predicting customer churn are the total day charge (0.081554), customer service calls (0.060915), international plan (No) (0.041021), and total evening charge (0.036929). These features have a significant impact on the model's decision-making process, with total day charge being the most impactful. Other features, such as total day minutes (0.028590), voice mail plan (0.023403), and total international calls (0.019784), also contribute to the prediction, but to a lesser extent. State-specific factors, while present, have a relatively minimal impact on the model's output.
