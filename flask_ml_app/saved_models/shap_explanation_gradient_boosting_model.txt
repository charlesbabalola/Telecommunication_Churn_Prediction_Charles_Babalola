The feature importance analysis for the gradient boosting model reveals that the most impactful factors in predicting customer churn are the total day charge, customer service calls, and total day minutes, with feature importance values of 0.431121, 0.429267, and 0.275834, respectively. Other influential features include international plan, total international calls, total evening charge, and international plan (Yes). State-specific factors have a relatively minimal impact on the model's output, with most states having feature importance values close to zero.
